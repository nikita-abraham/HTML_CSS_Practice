<!--STRUCTURE OF PAGES-->

<html>

	<head>
	<!--head tag comes before the body tag; contains information about the page;
	not shown in the browser window-->
		<title> This is the Title of the page </title>
		<!--elements in the title tag are either shown in the top of the browser, above
		where we would type the url in-->
	</head>	
		
  		<body>		
  		<!-- anything in the body tags will appear in the main browser window-->
			<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
			
				<p lang="en-us">This text might be an introduction to the rest of
        		   the page. And if the page is a long one it might
				   be split up into several sub-headings.<p> 
				<!-- 'lang' is an attribute name (indicates what kind of extra information we are 
					 supplying about the element's content)
						Should be written in lowercase
					 'en-us' is the attribute value (information of setting of the attribute)
            			Should be placed in double quotes-->

			<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
			<!-- Splitting up the text (by pressing enter) does not change the 
	        the way the text is displayed. Text moves to adapt to the width of the 
	        screen (responsive) -->
	        
				<p> Many long articles have <b> sub-headings </b> to help
				you follow the <i> structure of what is being written </i>. 
				There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
				<!-- the <b> element allows characters to appear bold-->
				<!-- the <i> element allows characters to appear italic -->
	
			<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
			
				<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p> 	
				<p> Super and Subscript Practice: On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn about E=MC<sup>2</sup>. </p>
				<p> The amount of CO<sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>. </p>
				<!-- the <sup> allows us to create superscripts (above text) and <sub> allows us to create subscripts (below text) -->
				
			<h2> Line Breaks </h2>
				<p> The Earth <br /> gets one hundred tons heavier everyday <br /> due to falling space dust </p>
				
			<h2> Horizontal Breaks </h2>
				<p> Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise </p>
				<hr />
				<p> Jupiter is bigger than all other planets combines </p>
