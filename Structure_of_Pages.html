<!--STRUCTURE OF PAGES-->

<html>
  <body>
	<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
	<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
         the page. And if the page is a long one it might
		be split up into several sub-headings.<p> 

	<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
	<!-- Splitting up the text (by pressing enter) does not change the 
	        the way the text is displayed. Text moves to adapt to the width of the 
	        screen (responsive) -->
	<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
		you follow the structure of what is being written. 
		There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
	
	<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
	<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p> 

    </body>
